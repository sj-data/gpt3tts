## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API Key
- gTTS library (`pip install gTTS`)
- pydub library (`pip install pydub`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Replace `API KEY HERE` in the code with your OpenAI API key.
3. Run the code using the following command: `python main.py`.
4. Enter a question or type `exit` to quit the program.
5. The AI assistant will generate a text response and read it out loud using gTTS.
